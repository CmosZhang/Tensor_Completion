# Tensor_Completion
Tubal_Alt_Min (tubal-alternating minimization) is a tensor completion algorithm, based on the low-tubal-rank tensor model. On both synthetic data and real-world video data, evaluation results show that compared with other completion algorithm, Tubal-Alt-Min improves the recovery error dramatically (by orders of magnitude).

in the figure, we display the three different sampling patterns.<br>
(a) random element sampling.<br>
(b) random tubal sampling.<br>
(c) random frontal slice sampling.<br>
